You need the neo4j python driver in order for this code to be useful, and for neo4j to be running in an obvious place.

You also need a graphdb installed in a neo4j database, like the one included in the project.

_pip install neo4j-driver_

My machine makes me do "pip2 install neo4j-driver". IMMV.
